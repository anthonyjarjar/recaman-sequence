# Recursive Visiualizer for the Recaman Sequence
## _Written in C using SDL2, and utilizes Adaptive Replacement Cache_



Though there are already sufficent visualizations of the Recaman Sequence, I felt as if I would have a good 
expirence creating one myself. This project would help build my skills in recursive functions as well as 
open the door to different types of memoizatoins. I was also interested in the SDL2 library, and found this
to be the most intriguing way to explore it.
